Subject: Request for Displaying Exact Record Count in Marketing Lists in Dynamics CRM

Dear Support Team,

When I create a marketing list, the displayed record count at the bottom of the screen shows an exact number only when there are fewer than 5,000 records. However, when the list contains more than 5000 records, it simply displays "5000+" without providing the exact count. This limitation persists even when the actual number of records exceeds 100000.

While it's possible to count the exact rows by download the marketing list to an Excel sheet.

Would it be possible through the CRM settings or configurations to display the exact number of rows, even for more than 5,000 records? 

Best regards,)
